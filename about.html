  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Players are dealt two cards, and the dealer also receives two cards, one face up and one face down.</li>
    <li>Players can then choose to "hit" (draw more cards) or "stand" (keep their current hand). Face cards (J, Q, K) count as 10, and an Ace can be 1 or 11.</li>
    <li>If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose. If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the player with the higher hand value wins.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>You can "double down" after you've received your initial two cards, before you hit or stand. This allows you to double your bet and receive one more card to improve your hand. Doubling down is a strategic move to potentially increase your winnings.</li>
    <li>If you're dealt two cards of the same number, you can choose to "split" them. This means you'll turn them into two separate hands instead of one. After splitting, you'll place an equal bet on the second hand, so now you have two bets.</li>
